            <p class="- topic/p p">Growing up, my family always owned a clunky computer located in our computer room. I
                can't say for sure, but I can only assume I started using it around the same time I
                started reading and writing, so I think around the ripe age of five. In the
                beginning, I mainly used the computer to play pinball, solitaire and minesweeper. I
                got the hang of logging in and out of a computer as well as its basic functions, but
                it wasn't until elementary school that I started to use computers for more
                educational reasons. I learned how to use Microsoft Office throughout elementary
                school and have been using it ever since. My 8th grade geography teacher introduced
                my peers and me to Google Suites, so I've been working within this software for
                awhile now. In high school, I took photography and learned how to use Adobe
                photoshop. I was in yearbook club and learned how to use Adobe InDesign. Growing up,
                I got to know basic skills and programs to succeed in school and life.</p>

            <p class="- topic/p p">When it comes to all things digital, I've usually been able to pick up on it quickly.
                I got a Facebook in the 5th grade and understood how to operate it within minutes,
                this process is applicable with all social media. I was the family member to turn to
                when a phone wasn't working or a laptop was malfunctioning. I wouldn't go as far as
                saying I was tech savvy, but I know my way around digital technologies. With all
                this confidence, I decided to try my hand in computer science. I enrolled in a
                computer science course here at the University of Minnesota, but something about
                certain coding languages wouldn't click in my brain. I ended up withdrawing from the
                course because it was that difficult for me. Ever since that course, I have been a
                little bit afraid of coding languages. I worked a job as a Communications Assistant
                where I worked with HTML and started to become more and more comfortable with
                coding. I also had the opportunity to learn DITA through an internship I worked the
                summer of 2020. If it weren't for my mentor, my learning of DITA would have been a
                lot different. I hope that with time and practice I become familiar with more and
                more coding languages because I know how beneficial it could be to be
                proficient.</p>

            <p class="- topic/p p">After taking the course <em class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ph i">Writing with digital technologies</em>, I was able to
                increase my digital literacy in a multitude of ways. I was able to expand my skills

            <p class="- topic/p p">Although I came across various challenges while learning new technologies, I was able
                to expand my skill set and become more aware of how certain technologies function
                and their implications for the future. When the class was assigned to explore the
                LavaCon webinar series, I got the opportunity to learn more about DITA and its
                importance in technical communications. This webinar taught me that DITA is becoming
                a widespread tool throughout technical communications. Seeing how relevant DITA was,
                I decided to craft my final project using DITA — increasing my proficiency in DITA
                and my digital literacy altogether. The following chapter will describe specific
                projects I worked on this semester that helped to increase my digital literacy.</p>

                project of the semester was to create a website using any technology or program that
                describes our digital literacy narrative throughout the years. I chose to craft my
                website using Google sites due to my familiarity of the program and its usability.
                This program can be easily learned and used, but offers template-based webpages
                which decrease the individualistic quality of websites. I created my Google site and
                it looked as follows:</p><img class="- topic/image image" href="file:/Users/katiesmrekar/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202020-12-17%20at%2012.28.24%20PM.png" id="unique_3_Connect_42_image_ury_bsf_14b" nd:nd-id="image_ury_bsf_14b" placement="inline" src="file:/Users/katiesmrekar/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202020-12-17%20at%2012.28.24%20PM.png"></img><p class="- topic/p p">I thought this project was a great project for the course to begin with.
                Students were able to deeply investigate their digital literacy and what
                technologies got them to where they are now. This project helped me to realize that
                I am proficient in many technologies due to the time period I was born in. I had a
                computer growing up, I got a smartphone in middle school, and every grade school I
                attended had Macbooks. I was fortunate enough to learn various technologies from a
                young age which made my digital literacy strong before this class had started. As
                mentioned previously, my digital literacy has increased tremendously due to the
                course — <em class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ph i">Writing with digital technologies</em>.</p></section>
        <section class="- topic/section section" id="unique_3_Connect_42_section_tfk_vrf_14b" nd:nd-id="section_tfk_vrf_14b"><h2 class="- topic/title title sectiontitle">Static site 1</h2><p class="- topic/p p">In the beginning of the
                Fall 2020 semester, the students of <em class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ph i">Writing with digital technologies</em> were
                assigned to create a website using HTML. I had little experience with HTML, so I was
                excited to learn more about the program and experiment with its functionalities.
                Eventually, I created my website and it looked as follows:</p><img class="- topic/image image" href="file:/Users/katiesmrekar/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202020-12-17%20at%2011.23.04%20AM.png" id="unique_3_Connect_42_image_sb5_csf_14b" nd:nd-id="image_sb5_csf_14b" placement="inline" src="file:/Users/katiesmrekar/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202020-12-17%20at%2011.23.04%20AM.png"></img><p class="- topic/p p">The creation of this website taught me the basics of HTML. I also learned more
                about rhetorical devices in website creation. HTML offers users to create websites
                from scratch while other platforms such as Wix or Google sites have templates to
                choose from. Using a mass market content management system takes away a website's
                opportunity for individualism and also creates less room for rhetorical devices. I
                believe that while HTML may be more strenuous, it offers web designers more
                flexibility and creativity than that of a template-based system. At the end of the
                semester, the class was assigned to create another static site to observe our
                progress in using digital technologies. The current webpage you are on acts as my
                end of the year, static site 2.</p></section>
